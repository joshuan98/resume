        Inquisitive is the word I would use to describe myself. When I am not puzzling over hardware and
        software in Computer Engineering, you can find me dabbling in personal projects or hackathons,
        seeking out opportunities to grasp. Be it joining an IoT company for experience, or scoping out
        augmented reality, I am ever-ready to step out of my comfort zone to broaden my horizons.
