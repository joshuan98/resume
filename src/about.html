      <p>
        Driven, inquisitive, and innovative, I am a soon-to-be graduate with a strong focus on full-stack development,
        set to complete my BEng in Computer Engineering by December 2024. My professional journey has equipped me with
        hands-on experience in software engineering, research analysis, and teaching. Whether developing XR applications
        for Apple Vision Pro, mentoring student teams in self-directed projects, or dabbling in hackathons worldwide, I
        am constantly pushing the boundaries of my knowledge. Proficient in TypeScript, Java, and frameworks like React,
        I am passionate about leveraging these skills to contribute to impactful, tech-driven solutions. Let's connect
        and explore how we can collaborate on transformative projects in the digital realm.
